      "*Pure communism* is the end goal of revolutionary activity.  And it relies on establishing sufficient infrastructure, productive forces (technology) and a consequential *culture of egalitarianism* to come into existence.  It is these factors, not vulgar rationing, which will allow for people to draw from the common wealth according to their material desires and engage in work wherein it can be said they are in no respect alienated from the product of their labor.\n",

      "What will **not exist** however (once the lower stages of socialism are well established) is **capital** (the private holding of the means of production.)  This means that no one will have the right to claim profit (labors of others) as income by virtue of simply holding a title.\n",
