# User settings on low level code : Environment arguments is set on env/__init__
Priority: 1

Problems occured:
1. Environment arguments are hardcoded in env/__init__.py
2. Users cannot easily customize environment parameters
3. Changes require modifying library code

Other Benefits:
1. More flexible configuration
2. Better separation of concerns
3. Improved maintainability

Possible Solution:
1. Move environment arguments as a user parameter somehow
2. Allow runtime parameter overrides

# Implement and Test COT
Priority: 2

Problems occured:
1. No popular Chain-of-Thought environment implementation

Other Benefits:
1. Enables testing of RL training workflow
2. Validates COT approach on simple math problems
3. Provides baseline for future improvements

Possible Solution:
1. Write COT Env âœ…
2. Run and make sure algorithm is working using `trainer.train_agent`
3. Add evaluation metrics for math problem accuracy
4. Test with different model architectures and hyperparameters

# Tight coupled Agent :  Abstract Agent
Priority: 2

Problems occured:  
1. Tight coupling between `trainer.load_ppo_agent` and `PPO.load`
2. Single agent supported, `PPO`

Other Benefits:  
1. 

Possible Solution:
1. Define abstract Agent class, make sure include `load` function
2. Refactor PPO to inherit Agent
3. Modify user implementation to use Agent.load and inference using Agent class.

# Implement Test Coverage
Priority: 2

Problems occured:
1. Limited test coverage for core functionality
2. Missing integration tests between components
3. No automated testing for math reasoning

Other Benefits:
1. Improved code reliability
2. Easier debugging and maintenance
3. Better documentation through tests

Possible Solution:
1. Write unit tests for COT environment
2. Add integration tests for training workflow
3. Test reward calculation and validation
4. Add test cases for different math problem types
5. Write unit tests for Agent abstraction
6. Add tests for PPO implementation
7. Test agent loading functionality
8. Add integration tests with environments

# Installation Test Environment
Priority: 2

Problems occured:
1. No automated testing of package installation
2. Potential dependency conflicts not caught early
3. Installation issues discovered late in deployment

Other Benefits:
1. Ensures reproducible development environment
2. Catches dependency issues early
3. Validates poetry configuration

Possible Solution:
1. Create test for fresh poetry environment setup
2. Verify all dependencies install correctly
3. Test import of key package components
4. Add CI workflow for installation testing
5. Test across different Python versions
